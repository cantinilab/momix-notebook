    "We first define the function that produces the simulated multi-omics datasets. The function simulates 3 -omics datasets (mRNA expression, methylation and protein quantification), using the CRAN InserSIM package. Each dataset is composed of 100 samples. We considered different scenarios. First, 'equally spaced' clusters (i.e., composed of the same number of samples) and heterogeneous clusters (i.e., composed of a variable number of samples). Second, different numbers of clusters are imposed on the data: 5,10,15. "
